    <h1>Welcome to BURGER POINT</h1>
    <p>In 2010 it all happened with <b>BURGER POINT</b> . He had been the owner of a small Burger restaurant in <b>Sector-15 part II HUDA market Gurgaon </b>. When he decided to purchase a Burger/Sandwich shop sanjay knew he wanted a limited but appetizing and affordable menu. He also understood the importance of listening to his customers.

        With a receptive attitude to what they liked, he added a Burger/sandwich here, eliminated one there. It worked. Business was good and getting better. And then, confident in the quality of his own special recipe for Veg. Surprise Burger /Veg. Chilli Lava Burger/Veg. ‘N’ Crisp Burger and Wraps also he featured it as the newest item on his modest menu. That really worked. The response was sensational. The neighborhood communities quickly embraced this small "local" Burger shop. They liked the food, service and attitude.
